## TrakRF-Web Content Migration - Phase 1: Static Homepage Foundation

- **Date**: 2025-10-19
- **Branch**: feature/content-migration
- **Commit**: 1920897
- **PR**: https://github.com/trakrf/www/pull/3
- **Summary**: Migrated 4 core marketing components from Next.js trakrf-web to Astro with static foundation
- **Key Changes**:
  - Extended Tailwind config with 5 custom animations (shimmer, wiggle, popup, appearFromRight, opacity)
  - Created global CSS with .btn-gradient class and smooth scroll behavior
  - Built 4 static components: Header, Hero, Problem, Footer
  - Integrated homepage with SEO metadata (OpenGraph, Twitter Card)
  - Downloaded and optimized image assets (859KB → ~300KB)
  - Added sharp@0.34.4 for image optimization
- **Validation**: ✅ All checks passed

### Success Metrics

**Phase 1 Targets** (from spec - foundation only):
- ✅ **Performance targets met** - **Result**: Build succeeds in 1.09s, images optimized (hero: 768KB → 261KB, icon: 23KB → 1KB)
- ✅ **Clean migration** - **Result**: 0 lint errors, 0 type errors, 0 console.log statements
- ⏳ **Visual parity achieved** - **Result**: PARTIAL - 4 of 7 homepage sections completed (Phase 1 scope per plan)
- ⏳ **All interactive elements functional** - **Result**: PARTIAL - Mobile menu stubbed, interactivity deferred to Phase 2
- ⏳ **Multi-page structure validated** - **Result**: NOT STARTED - Blog/legal pages deferred to Phase 3

**Overall Success**: 40% of full spec metrics achieved (2 of 5 fully complete)
**Phase 1 Success**: 100% of Phase 1 planned deliverables achieved (4 static components as specified)

### Notes

This is **Phase 1 of 3** for the content migration. The spec describes 10 total components across 3 phases:
- **Phase 1 (THIS)**: Static foundation - 4 components (Header, Hero, Problem, Footer) ✅
- **Phase 2 (NEXT)**: Interactive components - FeaturesAccordion, FAQ, Pricing, CTA
- **Phase 3 (FUTURE)**: Multi-page structure - Blog posts (3), Legal pages (2)

Phase 1 delivers exactly what was planned: a working static homepage foundation with optimized images and zero validation errors. The homepage is functional but incomplete (4 of 7 sections). Recommended to deploy after Phase 2 completion.
