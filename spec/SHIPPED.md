- **Commit**: c303b36de218a697f9356068ca371f1fc861c150
- **PR**: N/A (initial commit pushed directly to main)
- **Summary**: Established public repository foundation with complete open source documentation, development environment configuration, and CSW workflow infrastructure

### Key Changes

- Validated CSW infrastructure (spec/, spec/README.md, spec/template.md, spec/stack.md)
- Documented branch protection requirements (manual GitHub UI setup deferred)
- Created spec/astro-setup/ for next development cycle

### Technical Details
- **Stack**: Astro + Tailwind + TypeScript (setup deferred to next spec)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Node Version**: 24 (pinned in .nvmrc)
- **Deployment Target**: Cloudflare Pages
- **License**: MIT (not BSL like platform, not CC0 like mikestankavich.com)

### Success Metrics
-  Repository has complete public documentation
-  MIT license properly configured with correct copyright
-  CSW workflow infrastructure validated and functional
-  Bootstrap spec successfully documented (this entry)
-  Clean foundation established for astro-setup spec (next cycle)
